# Roll20PF2
Pathfinder 2 API utilities for Roll20

This is a set of utilities I found useful for running Pathfinder 2 in Roll20.

To use, currently you must cut and paste the entire `pf2utils.js` file into a new tab on the **API Settings** page.  This requires you to have a Pro Roll20 account.

Documentation is available at https://wiki.roll20.net/Script:Pathfinder_2_Utilities .
